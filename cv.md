### Summary:

Driven Architectural Designer with more than 10 years of experience, I believe that the tech industry could benefit from hiring more designers with backgrounds in architecture. Working in Revit, I started really enjoying the technical side of design - and I ended up joining the three-month coding bootcamp. Technology is the major part of being on top of today's best practices. If you are familiar with how to leverage IT tools to design something - you can design anything.

* Revit, AutoCAD, Lumion

### Code example: 

**To return the middle character from CODEWARS:** You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

```
function getMiddle(s)
{
  if (s.length % 2 == 1) {
      return s.substring((s.length / 2)+1, (s.length / 2)) 
    } else if (s.length % 2 == 0) {
        return s.substring((s.length / 2)-1, (s.length / 2)+1)
    } 
}
console.log(getMiddle("tower"));
console.log(getMiddle("bird"));
```
