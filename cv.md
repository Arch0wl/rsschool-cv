### Summary:

Driven Architectural Designer with more than 10 years of experience, I believe that the tech industry could benefit from hiring more designers with backgrounds in architecture. Working in Revit, I started really enjoying the technical side of design - and I ended up joining the three-month coding bootcamp. Technology is the major part of being on top of today's best practices. If you are familiar with how to leverage IT tools to design something - you can design anything.
